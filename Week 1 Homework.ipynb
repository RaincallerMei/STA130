We examined `df.dropna()` and `del df['col']` as strategies for managing incomplete data. `df.dropna()` is preferred when you want to keep all columns but discard rows with missing values, while `del df['col']` is useful for removing columns with excessive missing data. Applying `del df['col']` before `df.dropna()` can enhance efficiency and prevent unintended data loss.

    "2. Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, df.describe() would have different values in the count value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data. Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the count that result from doing something like df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, df.describe() gives a global view of each column's statistics across the entire DataFrame., while df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() provides a breakdown of statistics for col2 within each group defined by col1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, in df.describe(), missing values in a column reduce the overall count for that column.\n",
    "In df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe(), missing values are counted separately for each group. Different groups might have different numbers of non-missing values due to variations in the presence of missing data within those groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, df.describe() aggregates statistics over the whole dataset. df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() aggregates statistics separately for each group, so the count can vary significantly if col1 has a non-uniform distribution or many missing values."
